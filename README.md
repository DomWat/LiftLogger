<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



We created this site and app in order to provide users with a more efficient way of building and using different workout routines. We tried to make this an inclusive project for gym rats and those who are new to the workout scene. 

Why an app such as this can be helpfull:
* Especially for beginners who may not know all of the different types of exercises available this will help them choose different excercises to add to their routine based on the affected body part.
* It is a simple and straight forward app. We cut down on the complexity of it so that users can quickly find and use their different routines after making them. 
* This will be especially helful for beginners learning how to exercise more efficiently and to help them keep track of their progress but at the same time be very beneficial for more experienced exercisers.
